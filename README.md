markdown-it-react

Note: This repo is incomplete! Check back later when it is published on npm.

A better way to render markdown in React, without `dangerouslySetInnerHtml`.
Features:

* **Extensible**, so that you can insert custom `ElementType`s, such as using `Link` instead of the default `a`.

Have fun!

## Todos

* Add a `<Markdown />` element that renders text children using this renderer
* Add a reverse process (e.g. render tokens back to markdown), perhaps in a separate package
