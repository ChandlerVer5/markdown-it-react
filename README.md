markdown-it-react

A better way to render markdown in React, without `dangerouslySetInnerHtml`.
Features:

* **Extensible**, so that you can insert custom `ElementType`s, such as using `Link` instead of the default `a`.

Have fun!

## Installation

```
yarn add @thelukester92/markdown-it-react
npm install @thelukester92/markdown-it-react
```

## Todos

* Add a reverse process (e.g. render tokens back to markdown), perhaps in a separate package
